# A11y Slack

A dedicated accessibility space to ask questions, help other people figure stuff out or chat about accessibility in general.

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment or intimidation of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
