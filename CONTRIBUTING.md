## How to Contribute

When contributing, post comments and discuss changes you wish to make via Issues.

Feel free to propose changes by creating Pull Requests. If you don't have write access, editing a file will create a Fork of this project for you to save your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to a file will write it to a new Branch in your Fork, so you can send a Pull Request.

If this is your first time contributing on GitHub, don't worry! Let us know if you have any questions.
