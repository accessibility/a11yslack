		<h1>A11Y (Accessibility) Slack Community Code of Conduct</h1>

		<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
			<p><strong>Work in progress: </strong> Please stay tuned for more information to come.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>A dedicated accessibility space to ask questions, help other people figure stuff out or chat about accessibility in general.</p>
			<p>The current admins are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Marcy Sutton (lead) - <a href="https://github.com/marcysutton">@marcysutton</a></li>
				<li>Alex Umstead</li>
				<li>Cassey Lottman</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or place of employment. We do not tolerate harassment or intimidation of participants in any form. Nor do we allow ad hominem attacks, meaning attacks on a person's character rather than the substance of their argument. While disagreements do happen, we expect our community to be kind and professional.</p>
			<p>A core tenet of accessibility and disability rights is <em>"Nothing About Us Without Us"</em>. This is one area that is non-negotiable in our community. Therefore, it is accepted that someone may be asked to stop promoting a product, service, or idea that dismisses gathering of feedback from people with disabilities.</p>
			<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Logs and Records:</h2>
			<p><strong>Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public</strong>. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this Slack. We also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.</p>
			<p>We ask that members not repeatedly delete messages from Slack channels, either, as it affects the search history and creates gaps when users have commented.</p>
			<p>If you have issues with a shared channel or any other related matter, contact Marcy Sutton for assistance.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h2>Harassment:</h2>
			<p>Harassment includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion</li>
				<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
				<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names</li>
				<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate</li>
				<li>Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “<em>hug</em>” or “<em>backrub</em>”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
				<li>Threats of violence</li>
				<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>

			<h2>Reporting</h2>
			<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the lead admin in a DM (@marcysutton). They'll respond as promptly as they can.</p>
			<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h2>Consequences</h2>
			<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
			<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including deactivation from this Slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.</p>
